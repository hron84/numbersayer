Excercise descrption
--------------------

Create a Rails project, with a simple controller logic.

We need a web form, which has a numeric input field and a submit button.

When user gives an arabic number, the system shows the english phrase of the number.

For example:

    7    == seven
    42   == forty-two
    2001 == two thousand and one
    1999 == nineteen hundred and ninety-nine

That's all.

Extra points: write your code in TDD / BDD, use cucumber, rspec, or other test 
frameworks
